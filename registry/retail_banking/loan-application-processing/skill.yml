context:
  description: >
    AI-assisted processing of personal loan applications. The agent reviews
    submitted documentation, runs automated eligibility checks, prepares a
    recommendation for the underwriter, and communicates decisions to applicants.
  business_rationale: >
    AI assistance reduces manual processing time from ~4 hours to ~30 minutes per
    application, enabling faster decisions for customers while freeing underwriters
    to focus on complex edge cases and final approval.
