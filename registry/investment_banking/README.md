# Investment Banking — Agent Skills

This directory contains Agent Skill definitions for the Investment Banking business area, covering valuation modelling, financial analysis, and deal advisory workflows.

## Skill Owners

Supervised by the **Head of Investment Banking** and the **IB Compliance and Controls team**.
All skills require review and sign-off from `@org/investment-banking-supervisors`.

## Skills

| Skill ID | Name | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `investment_banking/retail-company-valuation` | Retail Company Valuation | draft | high |

## Governance Notes

All skills in this area operate under strict information barrier controls. The agent must never access or process material non-public information (MNPI). Any detection of MNPI triggers an unconditional veto and immediate escalation to IB Compliance.

Skills must not progress to `approved` status until the IB Compliance and Controls team has confirmed that information barrier and restricted list controls are functioning correctly in the target environment.
