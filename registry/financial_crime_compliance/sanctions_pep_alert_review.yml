    AI-assisted first-pass review of sanctions screening and Politically Exposed
    Person (PEP) alerts generated during customer onboarding and ongoing monitoring.
    The agent works through the compliance team's standard operating procedure
    checklist, presents a structured recommendation (Accept / Decline / Partial Match),
    and hands off to a human compliance officer for final disposition. The agent does
    not make binding decisions — it prepares the evidence package and proposes a
    recommendation under the four-eyes principle.
  business_rationale: >
    Legacy rule-based sanctions screening generates false-positive rates exceeding 90%,
    requiring 5–20 minutes of manual review per alert. Common names can generate
    hundreds of PEP and sanctions hits simultaneously. AI-assisted review reduces the
    time per alert to approximately 30 seconds for clear cases and ~1 minute for
    partial matches, enabling the same compliance team to handle twice the alert
    volume. This increases capacity to focus on genuinely suspicious cases while
    delivering a faster, less friction-laden onboarding experience for legitimate customers.
    Deployed under the Agentic Oversight Framework (AOF) four-eyes principle: all final
    decisions remain with the human compliance officer.

  risk_classification: critical

scope:
  approved_activities:
    - Query the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals list and HM Treasury/EU consolidated sanctions lists for name matches
    - Query the PEP (Politically Exposed Person) database for name matches
    - Query adverse media sources for references to the customer's name
    - Match the customer's name, address, and date of birth as provided at onboarding against the name and attributes on each hit
    - Translate customer names and document fields from non-Latin scripts or foreign languages to English for comparison
    - Check that the customer's age is consistent with the platform's Terms of Use requirements
    - Match the customer's state, city, and address fields against the location attributes of each sanctions or PEP hit
    - Perform OSINT link traversal to corroborate or refute a hit (e.g. verify that a sanctions entry refers to a deceased individual)
    - Corroborate hits with supplementary evidence including adverse media articles, LinkedIn profiles, or government publications
    - "Classify each hit as: confirmed match, partial match (yellow flag), or false positive"
    - Generate a structured evidence package summarising the data sources consulted, the reasoning followed, and the recommended disposition
    - Present the recommendation (Accept / Decline / Partial Match) to the human compliance officer for final approval
    - Log all data accesses, sources queried, reasoning steps, and recommended actions to the immutable audit trail

constraints:
  procedural_requirements:
    - Follow the compliance team's sanctions and PEP alert review SOP checklist in full before issuing any recommendation
    - Check all three matching dimensions for each hit — name, date of birth, and geographic location — before classifying the hit
    - Translate all non-Latin or foreign-language name fields to English before performing name comparison
    - Consult at least one supplementary evidence source (adverse media, government publication, or open-source record) before recommending Decline on a PEP or sanctions hit
    - Assign a confidence score to the recommendation and log it alongside the evidence package
    - Always present findings to a human compliance officer before any onboarding decision is recorded
    - Record a timestamped, immutable audit log entry for every data source queried, every decision step taken, and the final recommendation
    - When the confidence score falls below the defined threshold, treat the case as a Partial Match and escalate — do not recommend Accept
  unacceptable_actions:
    - Issue a final onboarding decision (approve or decline) without human compliance officer review and approval
    - Clear a hit where the customer's name is an exact match on the OFAC SDN list or HM Treasury Consolidated List without human escalation
    - Omit any checklist step from the SOP before issuing a recommendation
    - Access or process customer personal data beyond what is required to review the current alert
    - Share customer data or alert details with any third party not listed in the institution's data processing agreement
    - Use nationality, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics as a basis for flagging or clearing a hit
    - Suppress, edit, or omit any step from the audit log
    - Retain customer personal data beyond the regulatory retention period applicable to the jurisdiction
