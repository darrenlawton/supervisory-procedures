# Financial Crime Compliance — Agent Skills

This directory contains approved Agent Skill definitions for the Financial Crime Compliance business area, covering BSA/AML, sanctions screening, PEP reviews, and adverse media monitoring.

## Skill Owners
Supervised by the **Head of Financial Crime Compliance** and the **Group Risk and Compliance Committee**.
All skills require review and sign-off from `@org/financial-crime-compliance-supervisors`.

## Skills

| Skill ID | Name | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `financial_crime_compliance/sanctions-pep-alert-review` | Sanctions and PEP Alert Review | approved | critical |

## Governance Notes

All skills in this area operate under the **four-eyes principle**: the AI agent prepares a recommendation; a human compliance officer makes the binding decision. The agent is never authorised to issue a final onboarding disposition.

High-risk and critical skills require sign-off from the Group Risk and Compliance Committee before status is set to `approved`.
