  description: >
    AI-assisted first-pass review of sanctions screening and Politically Exposed
    Person (PEP) alerts generated during customer onboarding and ongoing monitoring.
    The agent works through the compliance team's standard operating procedure
    checklist, presents a structured recommendation (Accept / Decline / Partial Match),
    and hands off to a human compliance officer for final disposition. The agent does
    not make binding decisions — it prepares the evidence package and proposes a
    recommendation under the four-eyes principle.
  business_rationale: >
    Legacy rule-based sanctions screening generates false-positive rates exceeding 90%,
    requiring 5–20 minutes of manual review per alert. Common names can generate
    hundreds of PEP and sanctions hits simultaneously. AI-assisted review reduces the
    time per alert to approximately 30 seconds for clear cases and ~1 minute for
    partial matches, enabling the same compliance team to handle twice the alert
    volume. This increases capacity to focus on genuinely suspicious cases while
    delivering a faster, less friction-laden onboarding experience for legitimate customers.
    Deployed under the Agentic Oversight Framework (AOF) four-eyes principle: all final
    decisions remain with the human compliance officer.

constraints:
  procedural_requirements:
    - Follow the compliance team's sanctions and PEP alert review SOP checklist in full before issuing any recommendation
    - Assign a confidence score to the recommendation and log it alongside the evidence package
  unacceptable_actions:
    - Issue a final onboarding decision (approve or decline) without human compliance officer review and approval
    - Clear a hit where the customer's name is an exact match on the OFAC SDN list or HM Treasury Consolidated List without human escalation
    - Omit any checklist step from the SOP before issuing a recommendation
    - Access or process customer personal data beyond what is required to review the current alert
    - Share customer data or alert details with any third party not listed in the institution's data processing agreement
    - Use nationality, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics as a basis for flagging or clearing a hit
    - Suppress, edit, or omit any step from the audit log
    - Retain customer personal data beyond the regulatory retention period applicable to the jurisdiction
